# Better Exams
(A working title)

# Why?
The official [examinations.ie](https://www.examinations.ie) site is an abhorrent abomination that manages to break every UX rule. (I mean seriously, selecting Exam Papers or Marking Schemes first, really?!) This also was a way to improve my React skills. I've learnt a lot in the course of this project, and I hope that anybody wishing to emulate it will too.S

# Contribution
If for any reason you want to make a change, feel free to open up a pull request and I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible. It's greatly appreciated! (Just be warned that the codebase is as abhorrent as the examinations.ie site...)

This was heavily inspired by [examfinder.ie](https://examfinder.ie/) by Thomas Forbes. Many thanks to him for allowing me to use his data.json file.
